# Ravenous

## Codecademy Project

Welcome to the Ravenous project, where you’ll be building a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, you’ll be creating an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.

### Project Requirements

- Build the restaurant recommendation application using React
- Utilize HTML, CSS, and Javascript as part of the tech stack
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project, including:
    - The purpose of your project
    - Technologies used
    - Features
    - Future work
 
#### Project Purpose

Create an application that replicates the core functionnement of Yelp.
    
#### Features

- The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
- Users can search by typing in the search bar
- A list of restaurant data is presented to the user.

#### Prerequisites

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Git and GitHub
- HTTP Requests and Responses
- Authentication

#### Future Work

- ~~Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab.~~
- ~~Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab.~~
- Clicking on a different sorting option automatically re-queries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again.
- Implement your own type of sort.
- Allow to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on a keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking.
- Add autocompletion of addresses to the “Location” input.
