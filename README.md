# Ravenous

## Codecademy Project

Welcome to the Ravenous project, where you’ll be building a restaurant recommendation website that allows users to search for local businesses based on their location and keywords. Using a tech stack that includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and the Yelp API, you’ll be creating an application that replicates the core functionality of Yelp. If you want to get a feel for what Ravenous can be, visit the Yelp website and search for restaurants in your area.
